# 📊 Student Performance Analytics Dashboard

This project was created during my **RISE Internship** as a **BCA student**.  
It analyzes student marks, attendance, and login behavior to identify top performers and students needing support.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `data/` – contains the dataset (`students.csv`)
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter Notebook for analysis
- `output/` – saved plots
- `README.md` – this file
- `requirements.txt` – libraries used

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📈 What the Project Does

- Calculates average marks
- Estimates attendance percentage
- Simulates login counts
- Creates plots:
  - Correlation Heatmap
  - Attendance vs Marks
  - Performance Buckets

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Students with high attendance perform better
- Low login activity and attendance correlate with poor marks

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Install requirements:
   pandas
   matplotlib
   seaborn
   jupyter
2. Open the notebook:
   jupyter notebook notebooks/analysis.ipynb
